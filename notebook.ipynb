    "## DATA VALIDATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any analysis or drawing inferences, a comprehensive data validation\n",
    "process was conducted to ensure data integrity and reliability. The dataset was checked for\n",
    "missing values (NaNs), inconsistencies, and formatting issues that could affect calculations\n",
    "or insights.\n",
    "Overall, the dataset was in good condition, with only minor issues such as a few missing\n",
    "values and inconsistently entered sales method categories. The following corrections were\n",
    "made:\n",
    "\n",
    "● **Sales_Method:** The column contained inconsistent entries such as _“Em + call”_\n",
    "instead of _“Email + Call”_ and _“Em”_ for _“Email”_. These were standardized using\n",
    "Python’s .str.replace() and .str.capitalize() methods, resulting in three consistent\n",
    "categories: _Email_ , _Call_ , and _Email + Call_.\n",
    "\n",
    "● **Revenue:** The _Revenue_ column contained a few missing (NaN) values, which could\n",
    "have affected statistical calculations such as the mean. These were replaced with\n",
    "zero (0), representing instances where no revenue was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**● Years_as_Customer:** Company has been in existence since 1984, so the max value\n",
    "must be 41 as of 2025, but there were 2 extreme outliers - 47 and 63.\n",
    "\n",
    "● The other columns maintained integrity as they had no null values, nor did they\n",
    "contain incorrect datatypes.\n",
    "After applying these corrections, the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.\n",

    "![Number of Customers](no_of_customers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above chart shows the number of customers involved in each of the sales approaches.\n",
    "As we can see, Email method was able to pool in the highest number of customers, closely\n",
    "followed by Call Method, and the combined of both pooled the least.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Overall Revenue Spread](overall_rev_spread.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘Overall Revenue Distribution’ shows a wide spread, ranging approximately from\n",
    "0 to 250. Multiple peaks are evident, indicating varied sales segments or differing\n",
    "revenue patterns among methods or products. The right-skewed shape suggests\n",
    "that while most transactions generate moderate revenue, a smaller number of\n",
    "high-value sales drive the upper tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Revenue Spread by Each Method](spread_by_method.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘Revenue Spread by Method’ displays the spread of revenue among 3 different\n",
    "sales approaches. The Email method showcases extreme values ranging from 0 to\n",
    "150 (approx.), the median value being ~95, and values typically range between ~\n",
    "and 105. The combined method of Email and Call, displays higher revenue than the\n",
    "other 2 methods, with median being ~180, and values typically range between ~\n",
    "and 190. The Email method seems to have yielded the lowest revenue, where the\n",
    "median is ~50, and values range between ~40 and 60.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart illustrates the performance of the three sales methods over time.\n",
    "The Email method outperforms the others initially, generating exceptionally high\n",
    "revenue in the first week, which gradually tapers off in subsequent weeks.\n",
    "In contrast, the Email + Call method starts with lower revenue but steadily grows over\n",

    "combining personalized calls with email outreach effectively converts interest into\n",
    "purchases, with efficiency improving over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Email method shows moderate efficiency, beginning around 37% and reaching just\n",
    "below 47% by Week 6. While its growth is steady, it remains below the combined approach,\n",
    "suggesting that email alone is less effective at driving conversions despite its broader\n",
    "reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Call-only method performs the lowest initially (around 33%) but improves gradually to\n",
    "nearly 47% by Week 6. Although progress is visible, it remains the least efficient overall\n",

    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the primary business objective is to maximize sales, the company should\n",
    "prioritize the Email + Call approach. This method demonstrates a steadily increasing\n",
    "revenue trend over time and achieves the highest conversion rate, indicating that\n",
    "customers reached through this channel are more likely to complete a purchase after\n",
    "engaging with the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, it is recommended to continuously monitor the conversion rate and\n",
    "revenue performance across all sales methods to assess ongoing effectiveness and identify\n",
    "opportunities for further optimization."
